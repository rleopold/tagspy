TagSpy
========
A demo of several web technologies, TagSpy let's you "spy" on either a certain hashtag or 
geographical area for InstaGram content, which will be displayed in real time as it's tagged or created!

You can give it a spin at https://itagspy.azurewebsites.net/

Try creating a Tag subscription on "testing", then go to manage and start watching that tag. Post something
from Instagram and use that hashtag to see it instantly appear!
